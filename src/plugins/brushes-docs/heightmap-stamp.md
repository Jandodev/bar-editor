# Heightmap Stamp

Paint height deltas using a grayscale image as a stamp. Supports loading from:
- URL (PNG/JPG/WEBP)
- Local uploads (via Files panel)
- Embedded assets in /public/bar-editor-assets (with manifest.json)
- ambientCG API search (Terrain assets, picks height/displacement maps)

The brush samples the image over the brush area, applies optional radial falloff, and adds or subtracts from terrain based on the sampled luminance.

Controls
- Source
  - URL: Provide a direct image URL with CORS enabled.
  - Asset (bar-editor-assets): Uses /public/bar-editor-assets/manifest.json or a direct path under /bar-editor-assets. Example id: example-dunes â†’ /bar-editor-assets/example-dunes.png
  - Uploaded: Uses the first uploaded image by default or match uploadPath.
  - ambientCG Search: Query their API and auto-pick a height/displacement map from Terrain assets. Example: dunes, canyon, mountain
- Image URL: Only used when Source = URL.
- Asset ID/Path: Only used when Source = Asset. Accepts: id in manifest.json or direct path like myfolder/stamp.png.
- Uploaded Path: Optional filter to pick a specific uploaded image.
- ambientCG Query: Search string for ambientCG Terrain assets.
- Height Scale (m): Max amplitude applied at the stamp&#39;s center before falloff and strength, in world meters.
- Falloff Power: Exponent shaping the radial falloff (higher = sharper edge).
- Rotation (deg): Rotate the stamp around the brush center.
- UV Scale: Scales the sampling UVs. Values > 1 increase tiling density (more repeats if Tiling = Repeat); < 1 zooms into image center.
- Tiling: Clamp or Repeat when sampling outside [0..1].
- Centered (-0.5..+0.5): When on, remaps luminance (0..1) to (-0.5..+0.5) so mid-gray becomes neutral (no change), black lowers, white raises.
- Use Radial Falloff: Toggles the brush&#39;s radial falloff.

Notes
- Strength slider (HUD) is treated as a blend factor [0..1] for this brush. Values > 1 will clamp to 1 internally.
- The loader caches decoded images. When you change Source or the query/path, the loader begins fetching/decoding; painting will be a no-op until the image finishes loading.
- CORS: Remote images require CORS headers (crossOrigin=&#34;anonymous&#34; is used). If image fails to load, prefer uploading locally or using the /bar-editor-assets folder.
- AmbientCG: We use the v2 /full_json endpoint and heuristics to pick height/displacement images. If no height map is found, the preview image may be used as a fallback. Consider downloading locally and embedding for reliability.

Embedding assets
- Place images in: /bar-editor/public/bar-editor-assets/
- Optionally list them in /bar-editor/public/bar-editor-assets/manifest.json:
  {
    &#34;assets&#34;: [
      { &#34;id&#34;: &#34;example-dunes&#34;, &#34;label&#34;: &#34;Example Dunes&#34;, &#34;path&#34;: &#34;/bar-editor-assets/example-dunes.png&#34; }
    ]
  }
- You can also reference direct paths under /bar-editor-assets (e.g., &#34;myStamp.png&#34; or &#34;terrain/dunes.png&#34;) without a manifest entry.

Perf / Tips
- To stamp structures or terrain features crisply, increase Height Scale and reduce Falloff Power (e.g., 1.5) for a softer edge, or raise power (e.g., 4.0) for a rim-hard edge.
- Turn on Centered for bipolar stamping (mid-gray = no change). Keep it off for unipolar additions (black ~ 0, white ~ full raise).
- Use Repeat tiling with UV Scale > 1 to spray repeating micro-features (e.g., rocks, erosion noise).
- Combine with Smooth brush after stamping for organic blends.

FAQ
- Can I turn this into prefab stamps (structures)? Yes: pair this with object/feature placement tools, using the same source resolution/transform to place prefabs and paint height/texture data together.
- Does it edit full image each stroke? No. The brush updates only the affected terrain region inside the radius, sampling the decoded heightmap as a source.
